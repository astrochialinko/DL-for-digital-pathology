# Deep learning for digital pathology image analysis
This project will explore the use of deep learning techniques in digital pathology (DP) problems

- Group 1 (AstroCat)'s project for the 2023 La Serena School of Data Science
- Authors: Chia-Lin Ko, Leah Zuckerman, Luis Herrera, Juan Ramirez

## Dataset

### Lymphoma Dataset 
- The dataset consists of 374 images of size 1388 x 1040
- These are further broken down into three sub-types of lymphoma:
    - 113 for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
    - 139 for Follicular Lymphoma (FL)
    - 122 for Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)
- Data (1.4G) [(download here)](http://andrewjanowczyk.com/wp-static/lymphoma.tar.gz)
- Tutorial [(download here)](http://andrewjanowczyk.com/use-case-7-lymphoma-sub-type-classification/)
